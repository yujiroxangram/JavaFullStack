## Environment Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your Java development environment, choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and understanding the fundamental Git & GitHub workflow for effective collaboration.

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is essential for compiling and running Java applications.

**What is JDK?**
It's a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), and other tools.

**Download & Installation:**

1.  **Choose a JDK Distribution:**
    * **Adoptium (Recommended for Open Source):** Provides Eclipse Temurin builds, which are free, open-source, and production-ready.
        * Visit: [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
        * Download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version (e.g., JDK 17, JDK 21) for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    * **Oracle JDK:** Official builds from Oracle. May have licensing implications for commercial use depending on the version.
        * Visit: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

2.  **Installation Steps (General):**
    * **Windows:** Run the `.msi` installer and follow the prompts. The installer usually handles environment variables for you, but it's good to verify.
    * **macOS:** Run the `.pkg` installer.
    * **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk` for Debian/Ubuntu) or extract the tar.gz archive manually.

**Setting Environment Variables (If not set automatically):**

For Java to be accessible from any directory, you need to set `JAVA_HOME` and update your system `PATH`.

* **Windows:**
    1.  Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start Menu and select "Edit the system environment variables".
    2.  Click "Environment Variables..." button.
    3.  Under "System variables", click "New...".
    4.  Set Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
    5.  Set Variable value: The path to your JDK installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).
    6.  Find the `Path` variable in "System variables", select it, and click "Edit...".
    7.  Click "New" and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`. Move it up if needed.
    8.  Click OK on all windows.
* **macOS / Linux (Bash/Zsh):**
    1.  Open your terminal.
    2.  Open your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`).
    3.  Add these lines at the end:
        ```bash
        export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk  # e.g., /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-17 or /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
        export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
        ```
    4.  Save the file and apply changes: `source ~/.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`/`.bash_profile`).

**Verify Installation:**
Open a new terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
java -version
javac -version # You should see the installed JDK version for both commands.
```

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Setup

An IDE is crucial for efficient Java development, offering features like code completion, debugging, and project management.

#### Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)

IntelliJ IDEA is the most popular and feature-rich IDE for Java. The Community Edition is free and sufficient for most full-stack development.

* **Download:**
    * Visit: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
    * Download the **Community Edition** for your OS.
* **Installation:** Run the installer and follow the prompts.
* **Basic Project Setup:**
    * **Opening Existing Projects (like this repo):**
        * Open IntelliJ IDEA.
        * Click "Open" on the Welcome screen or `File -> Open...`.
        * Navigate to your cloned `JavaFullStack` repository folder and select it. IntelliJ will usually detect Maven/Gradle projects automatically.
    * **Creating New Java Projects:**
        * `File -> New -> Project...`
        * Select "New Project" from the left pane.
        * Choose "Maven" or "Gradle" (recommended for Spring projects).
        * Ensure your correct JDK is selected.

#### Alternatives (Optional)

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A lightweight, highly customizable editor.
    * Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * Install the **"Extension Pack for Java"** by Microsoft from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). This bundle provides Java language support, debugger, Maven, etc.
* **Eclipse IDE:** A traditional and powerful open-source IDE for Java.
    * Download: [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
    * Download "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers".

### 3. Git & GitHub: A Significant Approach

Git is a distributed version control system, and GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. Mastering them is essential for any developer.

#### What is Git & GitHub?

* **Git:** A version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It's designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
* **GitHub:** A cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It provides a web interface, access control, and collaboration features like issues and pull requests.

#### Installing Git

* **Download:**
    * Visit: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * Download the installer for your operating system.
* **Installation:**
    * Run the installer. For Windows, generally accept the default options unless you have specific needs. Ensure **"Git Bash"** is installed, as it provides a good command-line environment.

* **Verify Installation:**
    Open a new terminal (Git Bash on Windows) and type:
    ```bash
    git --version # You should see the installed Git version.
    ```

#### Initial Git Configuration

Before making your first commit, configure your name and email address. These will be embedded in your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com" # Replace "Your Full Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual details.
```

        git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaFullStack.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaFullStack.git) # e.g., git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaFullStack.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaFullStack.git)
        cd JavaFullStack
        ```

3.  **Add Upstream Remote:**
    * This step links your local repository to the *original* `JavaFullStack` repository, allowing you to fetch updates from it.
    * Run this command from your cloned local repository directory:
        ```bash
        git remote add upstream [https://github.com/yujiroxangram/JavaFullStack.git](https://github.com/yujiroxangram/JavaFullStack.git)
        ```
    * Verify remotes: `git remote -v` (you should see `origin` pointing to your fork, and `upstream` pointing to the original repo).

4.  **Create a New Branch:**
    * Before making changes, always create a new branch. This keeps your work isolated and makes managing changes easier.
    * It's good practice to sync with `upstream` first: `git pull upstream main` (or `master`).
    * Then, create your new branch:
        ```bash
        git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature-name
        ```
        *(Use a descriptive name, e.g., `feature/add-exception-handling-examples` or `fix/database-connection-bug`)*

5.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Implement your code, fix bugs, add documentation, etc., within your new branch using your IDE.

6.  **Stage and Commit Your Changes:**
    * Once you're done with a logical set of changes:
        ```bash
        git add .               # Stages all changed files in the current directory and subdirectories
        git commit -s -m "feat: Add brief descriptive commit message here"
        ```
        * The `-s` (or `--signoff`) flag is **crucial**. It signs off your commit, agreeing to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). Please ensure your Git `user.name` and `user.email` are configured correctly as these are used for the sign-off.
        * Use clear and concise commit messages (e.g., `feat:` for new features, `fix:` for bug fixes, `docs:` for documentation updates).

7.  **Keep Your Fork Synced (Before Pushing for PR):**
    * Before pushing your branch and opening a Pull Request, it's a good practice to ensure your `main` (or `master`) branch on your fork is up-to-date with the original repository.
    * Switch to your main branch: `git checkout main`
    * Pull latest from upstream: `git pull upstream main`
    * Switch back to your feature branch: `git checkout feature/your-awesome-feature-name`
    * Rebase your feature branch onto the updated main (optional but recommended for clean history): `git rebase main`

8.  **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
    * Push your new branch with your committed changes to your GitHub fork:
        ```bash
        git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature-name
        ```

9.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to your *forked* repository on GitHub.
    * You should see a prominent banner suggesting you open a Pull Request from your pushed branch. Click **"Compare & pull request."**
    * Alternatively, go to the original `JavaFullStack` repository and click the **"New pull request"** button. Select your fork and branch.
    * Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining what changes you've made and why.
    * Click **"Create pull request."**
